# mbed-os-example-wifi #

Wi-Fi example for Mbed OS

(Note: To see this example in a rendered form you can import into the Arm Mbed Online Compiler, please see [the documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/wi-fi.html#wi-fi-example).)

## Getting started with the Wi-Fi API ##

This is an example of a Wi-Fi application using the Wi-Fi APIs that [Mbed OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os) provides.

The program brings up the Wi-Fi and the underlying network interface and uses it to scan available networks, connects to a network and prints interface and connection details.

For more information about Wi-Fi APIs, please visit the [Mbed OS Wi-Fi](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/reference/wi-fi.html) documentation.

### Supported hardware ###

* All Mbed OS boards with build-in Wi-Fi module:
    * [ST DISCO IOT board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-L475E-IOT01A/) with integrated [ISM43362 WiFi Inventek module](https://github.com/ARMmbed/wifi-ism43362).
    * [ST DISCO_F413ZH board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-F413H/) with integrated [ISM43362 WiFi Inventek module](https://github.com/ARMmbed/wifi-ism43362).
* Boards with external WiFi shields.
    * [NUCLEO-F429ZI](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F429ZI/) with ESP8266-01 module using pins D1 and D0.

##  Getting started ##

1. Import the example.

   ```
   mbed import mbed-os-example-wifi
   cd mbed-os-example-wifi
   ```

   Or if you fetched the example with `git clone`, run `mbed deploy` inside the cloned repository.

1. Configure the Wi-Fi shield and settings.
   Edit ```mbed_app.json``` to include the correct Wi-Fi shield, SSID and password:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "wifi-ssid": {
            "help": "WiFi SSID",
            "value": "\"SSID\""
        },
        "wifi-password": {
            "help": "WiFi Password",
            "value": "\"PASSWORD\""
        }
    },
    "target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "platform.stdio-convert-newlines": true,
            "esp8266.provide-default" : false
        }
    }
}
```

   For build-in WiFi, you do not need to set any `provide-default` values. Those are required
   if you use external WiFi shield.

   A sample ```mbed_app.json``` file is provided for ESP8266 (```mbed_app_esp8266.json```).


1. Compile and generate binary.
    For example, for `GCC`:
    ```
    mbed compile -t GCC_ARM -m DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A
    ```

1. Open a serial console session with the target platform using the following parameters:
    * **Baud rate:** 9600
    * **Data bits:** 8
    * **Stop bits:** 1
    * **Parity:** None

1. Copy or drag the application `mbed-os-example-wifi.bin` in the folder `mbed-os-example-wifi/BUILD/<TARGET NAME>/<PLATFORM NAME>` onto the target board.

1. The serial console should display a similar output to below, indicating a successful Wi-Fi connection:
    ```
    WiFi example

    Scan:
    Network: Dave Hot Spot secured: Unknown BSSID: 00:01:02:03:04:05 RSSI: -58 Ch: 1

    Connecting...
    Success

    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Gateway: 192.168.0.1
    RSSI: -27

    Done
    ```
